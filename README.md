Computer Simulation Final Project
Matt Doherty, Nicholas Fong, Julia Marcondes, Christina Matera

Factory Project:
     - 7 different machines running at the same time
     - Machines come in two varieties: one is very fast but it breaks down and itâ€™s more expensive to repair, the other is slower but more reliable and is cheaper 
     - Find best combinations of slow/fast machines
     - We will get the beta distributions later
